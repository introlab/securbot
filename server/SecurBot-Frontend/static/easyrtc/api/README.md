The easyrtc.js file is built from the easyrtc_int.js file.

NOTE:Before trying to build it, you need to do the npm installs in the root easyrtc directory!

To build it, 

      go to the top level easyrtc directory
      execute "bower install"
      execute "grunt build_api"

You will need to install grunt first.
